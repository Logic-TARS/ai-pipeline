# Internal Agent Interface

This document is for internal agents and maintainers that call AI Pipeline from
Codex, Hermes, or another local automation layer. It describes the current task
submission surfaces, the persisted job contract, and the lower-tool adapter
boundary used by Photo-Process, MoneyPrinterTurbo, and social-auto-upload.

AI Pipeline is a single-operator automation service. MCP and lower-tool interfaces remain local-only; the Web UI and REST API may additionally use the guarded ZeroTier boundary documented in [ZeroTier Web Access](zerotier-web-access.md). Public-internet and ordinary physical-LAN exposure are unsupported. Before handing an agent integration to operations, run the production quality gate (`bash scripts/check.sh`) so formatting, lint, non-external/non-publish tests, package content checks, `uv pip check`, installed-wheel CLI smoke tests, and isolated wheel smoke tests all pass against the same artifact contract the agent will call.

## Contract Layers

There are two related contracts.

The upper task contract is:

```text
MCP / REST / CLI -> TaskInput -> Orchestrator -> JobSnapshot
```

Agents submit a `TaskInput`, receive or discover a `task_id`, and then read the
latest `JobSnapshot` plus append-only job events. The orchestrator owns routing,
status transitions, artifact persistence, and final success or failure state.

The lower execution contract is:

```text
Orchestrator -> adapter -> Photo-Process / MPT / SAU
```

Adapters isolate external local tools. They normalize command execution,
timeouts, stdout parsing, artifact paths, and validation requirements. Parent
jobs must still verify artifacts before committing them to the job snapshot.

## Upper Interfaces

### MCP

Start the MCP server:

```powershell
python -m content_pipeline.mcp_server
```

Primary agent-facing MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Return shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_capabilities` | Discover supported workflows, content types, safety defaults, and lower-tool contracts. | `{ "workflows": [...], "status_tools": [...] }` |
| `run_task_async` | Submit and immediately start a generic long-running task. | `{ "task_id": "...", "status": "queued" }` |
| `submit_task` | Create a queued task without starting it. | `{ "task_id": "...", "status": "queued" }` |
| `start_task` | Start a previously queued task by id. | `{ "task_id": "...", "status": "queued" }` or the existing status |
| `get_status` | Read the current persisted `JobSnapshot`. | `JobSnapshot` JSON |
| `get_job_events` | Read recent append-only events for a task. | `{ "task_id": "...", "events": [...] }` |
| `open_photo_process_debug` | Open Photo-Process' own foreground Gemini debug browser for human inspection. | `AdapterResult` JSON |
| `process_ai_art_async` | Submit and start the AI-art Photo-Process folder pipeline using a Photo-Process `process_name`. | `{ "task_id": "...", "status": "queued" }` |
| `process_japanese_images` | Submit and start the Japanese local image pipeline. | `{ "task_id": "...", "status": "queued" }` |
| `run_finance_video_async` | Submit and start the dedicated Finance Markdown-to-video pipeline. | `{ "task_id": "...", "status": "queued" }` |

Additional implemented MCP tools exist for compatibility or narrower
maintenance workflows:

| Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `run_task_sync` | Runs a generic task synchronously and returns the final snapshot or `{ "status": "failed", "error": "..." }`. Prefer async tools for browser, video, or upload work. |
| `get_external_tool_contracts` | Returns adapter contracts such as the current Photo-Process CLI JSON contract. |
| `process_ai_art` | Synchronous variant of the AI-art folder pipeline. |
| `generate_images` | Direct Gemini image generation helper for a content profile. |
| `render_video` | Direct MPT video rendering helper from image paths. |
| `list_profiles` | Lists available profile YAML files. |
| `list_jobs` | Lists recent job summaries from the local job store. |

MCP errors are not fully normalized today. For example, `get_status` and
`get_job_events` raise `ValueError("task not found")` when the task is missing.
Callers should present that as a missing-task error and should not retry blindly.

### REST

Start the guarded FastAPI listener:

```powershell
ai-pipeline serve
```

Loopback development may invoke Uvicorn directly with `--no-proxy-headers`; ZeroTier deployments must use the guarded CLI and the configured exact interface IP.

Implemented endpoints:

| Method | Path | Request | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | none | Minimal unauthenticated liveness result |
| `GET` | `/monitor/uptime-kuma` | none | Minimal unauthenticated liveness payload for Uptime Kuma monitors (`ok`, `service`, `status`) |
| `GET` | `/ready` | authenticated | Redacted readiness flags: `data_dir_available`, `profiles_available`, and `pipeline_defaults_available` |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | admin token | Session cookies and CSRF token |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | session and CSRF token | Clears session cookies |
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | authenticated | Authentication method |
| `GET` | `/ui/bootstrap` | authenticated | Non-sensitive Web form, status, and pipeline contract |
| `POST` | `/validate-task` | authenticated `TaskInput` | Normalized task, warnings, and task-bound fingerprint without creating a job |
| `POST` | `/run` | `TaskInput` JSON body | `{ "task_id": "...", "status": "queued" }`; publishing has additional guards |
| `GET` | `/status/{task_id}` | authenticated path parameter | `JobSnapshot` JSON, or HTTP 404 with `task not found` |
| `GET` | `/jobs` | authenticated filters | Recent job snapshots |
| `GET` | `/jobs/{task_id}/events` | authenticated | Recent audit events |
| `GET` | `/jobs/{task_id}/artifacts` | authenticated | Files registered by the job and contained in its directory |

The packaged operator console is served at `/` and uses the same endpoints, session, CSRF, publish confirmation, and guarded artifact contract. The REST service queues work on a local `ThreadPoolExecutor`; with `WEB_AUTH_REQUIRED=true`, automation supplies `Authorization: Bearer <WEB_API_TOKEN>`, while ZeroTier peers are accepted only from explicit CIDRs and physical-LAN/public exposure remain unsupported.

### CLI

Run a task file synchronously:

```powershell
python -m content_pipeline.orchestrator --task <task.json>
```

The CLI reads the JSON file as `TaskInput`, submits it, runs it, prints the final
`JobSnapshot` as JSON, and exits with code `0` for `succeeded` or `partial`.
Other final statuses return a non-zero exit code.

Open Photo-Process' foreground debug browser:

```powershell
python -m content_pipeline.diagnostics photo-debug --mode automation --url <gemini-or-gem-url>
```

This diagnostic command does not create or update an AI Pipeline job. It returns
an `AdapterResult` JSON envelope and exits with code `0` only if the debug
process was launched.

For a user-visible desktop window, first start the localhost helper from the
Windows desktop session:

```powershell
python -m content_pipeline.desktop_browser_helper
```

Then call:

```powershell
python -m content_pipeline.diagnostics photo-debug --mode desktop --url <gemini-or-gem-url>
```

Agents that need a script-only setup path may register the helper as a Windows
scheduled task instead of asking the user to open the helper manually:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install_desktop_browser_helper_task.ps1
```

The installer does not open Chrome or navigate to Gemini. It only registers
`AI Pipeline Desktop Browser Helper` to run at user logon in the interactive
Windows session. To request an immediate helper start without opening a browser:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install_desktop_browser_helper_task.ps1 -StartNow
```

Verify the helper before using desktop mode:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8767/health
```

Remove the scheduled task with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\uninstall_desktop_browser_helper_task.ps1
```

## Core Data Structures

These structures are defined in `content_pipeline.models`.

### TaskInput

```json
{
  "description": "Human-readable task description",
  "content_type": "anime | finance | ai_briefing | ai_art | grouped_anime | japanese | unknown | null",
  "topic": "Optional route topic",
  "publish": false,
  "publish_targets": [],
  "params": {}
}
```

Rules:

- `publish` defaults to `false`; upload work requires explicit `true`.
- `content_type` may be omitted and resolved by routing, but task-specific MCP
  tools set it directly.
- `params` is branch-specific and remains the current extension point.

### PublishTarget

```json
{
  "platform": "douyin | kuaishou | bilibili | tencent",
  "account": "account display name or identifier",
  "tid": 21,
  "visibility": "private | public"
}
```

Rules:

- `account` is required.
- `tid` is required for `bilibili`.
- `visibility` defaults to `private` (仅自己可见). Set it to `public` to
  publish openly; both modes require uploader proof of the selected
  visibility, and changing it invalidates the publish confirmation
  fingerprint. `tencent` ignores `visibility` and always saves a draft.
- Finance supports only Douyin and Kuaishou publishing in the current
  local contract.

### JobSnapshot

```json
{
  "task_id": "hex id",
  "status": "queued | running | succeeded | failed | blocked | partial",
  "current_step": "route | source_scan | image | video | archive | upload | complete | null",
  "task": {},
  "route": {},
  "artifacts": {},
  "error": null
}
```

The job store persists the snapshot as:

```text
<data_dir>/jobs/<task_id>/status.json
```

It also appends events to:

```text
<data_dir>/jobs/<task_id>/events.jsonl
```

Known event names include `job_created`, `step_started`, `route_resolved`,
`upload_skipped`, and `job_finished`. Treat the event log as audit evidence,
not as the only source of current status.

### ArtifactSet

```json
{
  "images": [],
  "video": null,
  "upload_result": null,
  "validation": {},
  "source_results": [],
  "groups": [],
  "source_document": null,
  "narration_script": null,
  "script_path": null,
  "subtitle": null,
  "mpt_task_dir": null,
  "handoff_path": null,
  "external_status_path": null,
  "manifest_path": null,
  "publish_results": {}
}
```

Important evidence fields:

- `validation.images`: decoded image count and dimensions.
- `validation.video`: duration, dimensions, aspect ratio, codecs, and decoded
  audio/video frame counts.
- `source_results`: per-source AI-art or Japanese image processing result.
- `groups`: per-group grouped-anime artifacts, including video validation and
  per-platform publish results.
- `publish_results`: platform-specific uploader evidence. A target can fail
  while another succeeds, producing a `partial` job.
- `external_status_path` and `manifest_path`: pointers to lower-tool status or
  manifest evidence when a branch records it.

### JobStatus

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | Task exists and has not started. |
| `running` | Orchestrator is executing the current step. |
| `succeeded` | All required work completed. |
| `failed` | The job failed and should not be treated as complete. |
| `blocked` | The job stopped on a safety or capability boundary, such as unsupported private visibility. |
| `partial` | Local artifacts or some publish targets succeeded while at least one independent target failed. |

### PipelineStep

| Step | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `route` | Resolve content type, topic, and route params. |
| `source_scan` | Read and validate local source material. |
| `image` | Generate, edit, or validate images. |
| `video` | Render and validate video. |
| `archive` | Move or record processed source files when the branch supports it. |
| `upload` | Publish through supported upload adapters. |
| `complete` | Terminal successful or partial completion marker. |

## Downstream Interface Standard

The downstream interface is the boundary from the orchestrator to local tool
adapters:

```text
Orchestrator -> adapter -> Photo-Process / MPT / SAU
```

The adapter is the stable boundary. The orchestrator should not depend on
Gemini browser state, MoneyPrinterTurbo internals, uploader UI details, or
tool-specific log formats except through adapter-owned results and evidence.

Required standards:

- Clear boundary: each adapter owns subprocess execution, tool-specific
  arguments, stdout/stderr handling, timeouts, retries when supported, and raw
  tool quirks.
- Stable input: callers pass explicit paths, prompts, params, config-derived
  executables, and publish targets. The adapter contract must not require hidden
  UI state beyond the lower tool's own authenticated local session.
- Machine-readable output: adapters must expose a result shape that callers can
  parse deterministically. For Photo-Process today, this is the final JSON
  object printed to stdout.
- Classifiable errors: failures must carry a human-readable message and the
  most stable available error type or code. Missing config, invalid input,
  timeout, no output, validation failure, and publish failure should be
  distinguishable.
- Artifact revalidation: a lower-tool success return is not enough for job
  success. The parent pipeline must revalidate images, videos, audio, subtitles,
  and publish evidence before updating the job as successful.
- Evidence handoff: generated artifact paths, validation metadata, lower-tool
  status or manifest paths, relevant logs, and publish results should be written
  back into `JobSnapshot.artifacts` so another agent can audit the run.
- Fail closed: when an adapter cannot parse output, cannot find an artifact,
  cannot validate media, or cannot prove private visibility for publishing, the
  parent job must report `failed`, `blocked`, or `partial` instead of treating
  the run as successful.

In short, downstream adapters must provide a clear command boundary,
deterministic machine-readable results, classifiable failure information,
independently verified artifacts, and enough evidence for the orchestrator to
persist in `JobSnapshot`.

## Photo-Process Adapter Contract

The default Photo-Process boundary is a CLI JSON adapter. When the trusted-local
`PHOTO_PROCESS_WORKER_URL` is configured, the orchestrator instead calls that
Photo-Process Browser Worker's `POST /api/comic` endpoint. Both paths return the
same final Photo-Process JSON payload and are normalized by
`content_pipeline.tools.photo_process_client`.

The Worker path is preferred for real browser work: it serializes requests for one
production Chrome profile and reuses one persistent Playwright context. The Worker
must remain on localhost; callers must not expose it publicly.

Photo-Process now implements the standardized `AdapterResult` envelope. The
legacy `call_photo_process(...) -> Path` helper remains as a compatibility
wrapper around `run_photo_process_adapter(...) -> AdapterResult`.

Command shape:

```powershell
<photo_process_python> <photo_process_dir>\main.py comic --image <image> --prompt <prompt> --json
```

Optional target selectors may be appended before `--json`:

```powershell
--target-gem-name <name>
--target-gem-url <url>
```

The adapter runs with:

- working directory: `settings.photo_process_dir`
- timeout: `900` seconds
- `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`
- `PYTHONUTF8=1`

Lower-tool success JSON:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "image_path": "absolute generated image path",
  "width": 765,
  "height": 1024,
  "aspect_ratio": 0.747,
  "target_aspect_ratio": "optional parsed target",
  "source_done_path": "optional moved original path"
}
```

Lower-tool failure JSON:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "human-readable failure reason",
  "error_type": "input_error | no_output | subprocess_error | upstream-specific"
}
```

Owned behavior:

- Gemini browser automation.
- Current-response candidate selection.
- Image decode and aspect-ratio validation inside Photo-Process.

Caller rules:

- Pass staged copies when originals must be preserved.
- Parse only the final JSON object from stdout. The current adapter scans stdout
  from the end and accepts the last JSON object line.
- Treat non-success JSON as adapter failure and include `error_type` in the
  raised message when present.
- Resolve relative `image_path` values against `settings.photo_process_dir`.
- Validate the generated artifact before copying it into the parent job.
- Validate the copied parent-job artifact again before committing it to
  `ArtifactSet`.

The adapter may return an existing matching output file if it already validates.
Agents should therefore use the job snapshot and validation metadata, not command
execution alone, as completion evidence.

### Photo-Process Foreground and Background Modes

Photo-Process already owns the browser visibility contract. AI Pipeline callers
must not bypass the adapter by launching Chrome directly to inspect Gemini.

Current Photo-Process settings:

- `show_chrome=true` means the lower tool launches Chrome in foreground mode.
- `show_chrome=false` means the lower tool runs through the corresponding
  headless/background mode.
- `headless` is a compatibility mirror of `show_chrome`; callers should treat
  `show_chrome` as the operator-facing switch.

Current Photo-Process foreground inspection entrypoints:

```powershell
python main.py ask <image> <prompt>
python 启动调试浏览器.py "https://gemini.google.com/gem/..."
```

Contract rules for AI Pipeline agents:

- Normal pipeline execution uses the configured local Browser Worker when
  `PHOTO_PROCESS_WORKER_URL` is set; otherwise it uses the compatibility CLI JSON
  adapter (`main.py comic --json`). Both paths persist the returned `AdapterResult`.
- If a human needs to watch or manually inspect Gemini, stop treating that as an
  AI Pipeline adapter action and use Photo-Process foreground inspection
  entrypoints instead.
- Do not use external Chrome process launches as completion evidence. They may
  create background processes without a visible desktop window and do not prove
  that the Photo-Process adapter contract ran.
- A visible Gemini page is diagnostic evidence only. Job success still requires
  the adapter JSON result plus parent-job artifact validation.

AI Pipeline exposes the same foreground inspection path as a diagnostic wrapper:

```powershell
python -m content_pipeline.diagnostics photo-debug --mode automation --url <gemini-or-gem-url>
```

The wrapper validates the Photo-Process directory, Python executable, and debug
script, checks whether the configured Chrome profile is already in use, launches
`启动调试浏览器.py`, and returns an `AdapterResult` with the command, PID when
available, visible-window probe results, and
`logs/frontend_dom_snapshot.json`. If the profile is already in use, it reports
a failure result and does not close or kill the existing browser process.

There are two debug modes:

- `automation`: runs Photo-Process' Playwright debug script. This can update
  `logs/frontend_dom_snapshot.json` even when the launched Chrome is not visible
  in the user's desktop session. If no visible Chrome window is detected, the
  wrapper returns `VALIDATION_FAILED` instead of success.
- `desktop`: calls a user-started localhost helper at `127.0.0.1:8767` to open a
  normal visible Chrome window in the user's desktop session. If the helper is
  not running, the wrapper returns `DESKTOP_HELPER_UNAVAILABLE`.

The desktop helper can also be installed by script as a scheduled task:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install_desktop_browser_helper_task.ps1
```

This is the preferred script-only path for agents. A script launched from a
background agent session must not directly launch Chrome and claim that it
opened a visible browser, because Windows may create a Chrome process with no
visible desktop window. The scheduled task exists to move the helper process
into the user's interactive logon session; actual page opening still happens
later through `photo-debug --mode desktop`.

When a requested `/gem/<id>` URL lands on `https://gemini.google.com/app` in the
snapshot, the wrapper returns `GEM_ACCESS_FAILED`. That means the current
profile did not enter the requested Gem and the caller should not treat the Gem
URL as usable evidence.

Standardized success result:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "tool": "Photo-Process",
  "code": "OK",
  "message": null,
  "artifacts": {
    "image_path": "absolute generated image path",
    "processed_path": "absolute copied parent-job artifact path",
    "format": "PNG",
    "width": 765,
    "height": 1024
  },
  "evidence": {
    "command": ["..."],
    "cwd": "Photo-Process working directory",
    "timeout_seconds": 900,
    "validation": {}
  },
  "raw": {
    "photo_process_json": {}
  }
}
```

Standardized failure result:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "tool": "Photo-Process",
  "code": "NO_OUTPUT",
  "message": "human-readable failure reason",
  "artifacts": {},
  "evidence": {},
  "raw": {}
}
```

## Other Adapter Boundaries

MoneyPrinterTurbo is called by the orchestrator for video generation branches.
The parent job is responsible for validating the final MP4 before success:
vertical dimensions where required, decodable video frames, usable audio when
voiceover is expected, and subtitles when the branch requires them.

social-auto-upload is called only when `TaskInput.publish` is `true`. Publishing
adapters must fail closed on visibility evidence: targets default to private,
may explicitly select public, and either mode requires uploader proof of the
selected visibility. For Finance, supported
targets are Douyin account `金融破壁人` and Kuaishou account `搞AI的罗辑同学`; Finance
must not publish to Bilibili and must not enter the Gemini image flow.

## Recommended Agent Workflow

1. Call `list_capabilities`.
2. Build a `TaskInput` or call the task-specific MCP async tool.
3. Keep `publish=false` unless the user explicitly authorized publishing.
4. Store the returned `task_id`.
5. Poll `get_status(task_id)` until `status` is terminal.
6. Read `get_job_events(task_id)` for audit trail and troubleshooting.
7. Verify artifacts from `artifacts.validation`, `publish_results`, and any
   status or manifest paths before reporting completion.

Terminal statuses are `succeeded`, `failed`, `blocked`, and `partial`.

## Next Standardization Targets

These are implemented for Photo-Process and remain standardization targets for
the other adapters.

### AdapterResult

Adapters should converge on a shared result envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "tool": "Photo-Process",
  "code": "OK",
  "message": null,
  "artifacts": {},
  "evidence": {},
  "raw": {}
}
```

Suggested fields:

- `ok`: boolean success flag.
- `tool`: adapter name.
- `code`: stable machine-readable code.
- `message`: human-readable detail.
- `artifacts`: normalized output paths and metadata.
- `evidence`: validation, logs, manifests, or status paths needed by callers.
- `raw`: adapter-specific payload for debugging.

### ErrorCode Taxonomy

Recommended shared codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `OK` | Adapter completed successfully. |
| `CONFIG_ERROR` | Required local path, executable, profile, or setting is missing or invalid. |
| `INPUT_ERROR` | Caller supplied invalid task or source data. |
| `SOURCE_NOT_FOUND` | Requested source file, folder, or daily handoff does not exist. |
| `SOURCE_SCAN_FAILED` | Source exists but does not contain required content. |
| `EXTERNAL_TOOL_FAILED` | Subprocess or browser-backed lower tool failed. |
| `NO_OUTPUT` | Lower tool finished without producing the expected artifact. |
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | Produced artifact failed decode, aspect, audio, subtitle, or count validation. |
| `PRIVATE_VISIBILITY_UNSUPPORTED` | Upload target cannot prove private visibility. |
| `PUBLISH_FAILED` | Upload attempted but did not produce success evidence. |
| `ALREADY_PUBLISHED` | Deduplication found a prior successful upload for the artifact. |
| `DESKTOP_HELPER_UNAVAILABLE` | Foreground desktop helper is not reachable on localhost. |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | The production browser profile exposes a Google sign-in control; a chat textbox alone is not authentication evidence. |
| `BROWSER_BUSY` | Another process or task owns the production browser profile. |
| `GEM_ACCESS_FAILED` | Requested Gemini Gem URL did not remain accessible in the current profile. |
| `UI_CHANGED` | Required Gemini control is absent or its supported selectors no longer match. |
| `TIMEOUT` | Adapter exceeded its allowed runtime. |

Until this taxonomy is implemented end to end, callers should continue reading
current `status`, `error`, `events`, and branch-specific artifact evidence.
